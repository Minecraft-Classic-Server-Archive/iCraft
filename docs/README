Thanks for choosing iCraft as your Creative Multiplayer software.

=========================
========== NOTE:
=========================

iCraft is NOT for Alpha, so the Alpha client will NOT work
with iCraft. If you are looking for a Survival Multiplayer software
then we recommend you to use myne2.

=========================
========== SUPPORT:
=========================

Need support? Want to chat or hang out with us? Go to irc.esper.net
#iCraft (or hlmc.net)

========== INSTALL:
=========================

Step 1: Install Python 2.6, Python 2.5/2.7/3.x will not work with
iCraft.

Download and extract the reqs folder in to your iCraft folder

Step 3: Configure the config files found in the config folder (rename
all of them with .example.conf to .conf)

Step 4: Get on and enjoy iCraft, as it should now be working. Good luck
with your server.
