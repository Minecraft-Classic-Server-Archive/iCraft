IDEAS: Undo by date, region and player (ungrief)
For anyone who is interested in helping, these are the current functions that the tracker module has:
[ http://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html | http://www.sqlite.org/lang.html ]

A write table function - writes to the database for a world;
def writetable(self, blockoffset, name, date, before, after)

A readname function that accepts both tuples, lists, and single values.
This function returns all data of blocks placed by a player or multiple players;
def readname(name)

A get offset function that works like the readname function,
but returns data based upon a single offset or list of offsets;
